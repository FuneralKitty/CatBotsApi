# CatBots API

This repository contains a solution for the [backend-cats-api task](https://github.com/itc-code/test-assignments/tree/main/backend-cats-api). The project is built with Flask and PostgreSQL, running in Docker containers.

## Overview

The CatBots API allows you to manage and query a database of cats. You can add new entries, retrieve lists of cats with specific attributes, and handle common operations through a RESTful interface.

### API Endpoints

- **Add a Cat (POST)**
  - Example:
    ```sh
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/cat \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"name": "Tihon", "color": "red & white", "tail_length": 15, "whiskers_length": 12}'
    ```

- **Retrieve Cats (GET)**
  - Example:
    ```sh
    curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/cats?attribute=color&order=asc&offset=5&limit=2"
    ```
